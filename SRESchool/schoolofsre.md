### Comamand Line Basics
#### File System Organization

bin | The executable program of most commonly used commands reside in bin directory

sbin | This directory contains programs used for system administration.

home | This directory contains user related files and directories.

lib | This directory contains all the library files

etc | This directory contains all the system configuration files

proc | This directory contains files related to the running processes on the system

dev | This directory contains files related to devices on the system

mnt | This directory contains files related to mounted devices on the system

tmp | This directory is used to store temporary files on the system

usr | This directory is used to store application programs on the system

#### Added Commands to Devops Tools Library

* sed
* sort

##### Comparing to a Desktop or Laptop Environment or Web Server Environment

* Note - the "usr" file is more like, "Applications" in MacOS. On a webserver this might be where var/www is placed.
* /home/ is more like the /home directory in MacOS, with perhaps Documents, Downloads or other files stored here.
