# Data

## Relational Databases

* Concepts: Pre-Read

[RDBMS Concepts](https://beginnersbook.com/2015/04/rdbms-concepts/)

* Tables
* Record/Tuple
* Field/Column
* Domain (permitted values)
* Instance
* Keys

### Key Concepts

* Relational DB's are used for data storage, with a specific set of goals: Efficiency, Ease of Access, Organiation, Handle Relations.
* ACID - atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability.
* Atomicity - ensures that partially failed transactions can be rolled back.
* Consistency - ensures that the balance between transactions does not even occur.
* Isolation guaragtees that multiple sub-operations which make up a transaction do not overwrite each other.
* Durability ensures that changes are applied correctly during recovery.

CRUD Operations

* CRUD - create, read, update, delete.
#### Classifying Operation by Type:

Management Operations

* DDL - definition
* DML - manipulation
* DCL - control
* TCL - transactions

* insert - transaction; inserting a value is a transaction
* create - definition; creating a table is to define something, no values inserted
* drop - definition; dropping or deleting tables
* delete - manipulation; deleting values is equivalent to changing, manipulating
* update - manipulation; updating a value
* commit - transaction; creating an entry
* rollback - manipulation; similar to updating
* truncate - manipulation; similar to deleting
* alter - manipulation; similar to deleting
* grant - control; granting actual outside access
* revoke - control; granting or revoking access

#### Other Definitions

* Constraints - rules for data that can be stored. Queries fail if defines rules are violated.
* Indexes - using a B+ structure, speeding up the fetching of rows and queries.
* Joins - allows you to fetch related data from multiple tables
* Access control - privledged accounts for admin tasks and regular accounts for clients

#### Popular Databases

* Commercial, closed source - Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2
* Open source with optional paid support - MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL

### MySQL

* Read through this...similar to Postgres

* Has an application layer which covers connection handling, authentication, security.
* Has a server layer which covers backup and restore, SQL interface, parser and optimization.
* Storage engine - InnoDB, which is the most widely used, transaction support, ACID compliant, crash recovery, etc.
* Possible to migrate from one storage engine to another, but this migration locks tables for all operations.

### InnoDB

* Memory - buffer pool, LRU cache of frequently used data. Has a change buffer, adaptive hash index, log buffer, which holds log data before flush to disk.
* Disk - stores data in rows and columns.
* Indexes - helps find rows with specific column values quickly.
* Redo logs - all transactions are written to them.

### Backup and Recovery

* Physical Backup - data directory as it is on the disk
* Logical Backup - table structure and records in it.

#### Mysqldump

This utility is available with MySQL installation, helps with the logical backup of the database, outputs a set of SQL statements to reconstruct the data, it is not recommended to use for large tables as it may take a lot of time and the file size will be huge.

```
mysqldump [options] > dump_output.sql
```

To dump all databases...

```
mysqldump -u<user> -p<pwd> --all-databases > dbs.sql
```
To dump a single database, a specific one:

```
mysqldump -u<user> -p<pwd> --databases db1 db2 > dbs.sql
```
Specific tables:

```
mysqldump -u<user> -p<pwd> db1 table1 table2 > db1_tables.sql
```
##### Restoring

From shell

```
mysql -u<user> -p<pwd> < all_dbs.sql
```

from shell if database already created:

```
mysql -u<user> -p<pwd> db1 < db1.sql
```

or from within MySQL Shell:

```
mysql> source all_dbs.sql
```

##### Percona Xtrabackkup

Utility which provides backups.

* Full, partial or cumulative.

* There are other SQL backup tools. - point-in-time recoveries, mysqlpump, mysqldumper, etc.

### MySQL Replication

Replication enables data from on MySQL host (primary) to be copied to another host, (replica). MySQL replication is asynchronous by nature by default, but it can be changed to semi-synchronous.

#### Applications 

* Read-scaling: set up as many replicas as we need and scale reads through them, which improves write performance, as the primary source is only dedicated to writes and not reads.
* Backups using replicas.
* Disaster recovery.

#### Asynchronizations

* Asynchronous is the default method. One host serves as the primary and one or more as the replicas.
* Semi-synchronous means that a commit is performed on the primary host is blocked until at least one of the replicas acknowledge it. This ensures strong consistency.
* Delayed - we can deliberaly delay, so that the replicas get updated and show the source of truth later. This safeguards against human errors, e.g. if a drop database is executed by mistake on the primary, the replica may still have the original copy, for a while at least.

### Conclusion

## NoSQL

* NoSQL just means, "non-relational database."  It's a generalized term.
* Putting developer hours first rather than storage costs.

### NoSQL Types

1. Document Databases - store data in documents similar to JSON. An example would be MongoDB's bson format.

2. Key-Value Databases - similar to the document concept, but with keys and values. Good for large amounts of data but don't want to perform complex queries to retrieve it. Example is Redis or DynamoDB.

3. Wide-Column Stores - store data in tables, rows and dynamic columns. Provides flexibility over relational databases, because each row is not required to have the same columns, e.g. you can map multiple rows and columns across, "sheets / tables." These might also be considered to be key-value databases in 2-dimensions. This may be used to store large amounts of data and you can predict what query patterns might be like. Cassandra and HBase are two of the most popular data stores.

4. Graph Databases - Store data in nodes and edges.  Nodes might store information about people, places, things and edges store information about relationships between the nodes. Some of these databases may depend upon a relational engine which stores the graph data in a table, which imposes another level of abstraction between the graph database and how it is actually stored. Others may use key-value store or document-oriented database for the actual storage. These databases excel in areas where you need to traverse relationships and look for patterns such as social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines, etc. Neo4j is an example of a graph database.

#### Performance, Scalability, Flexibility, Complexity, Functionality

* Performance, Scalability, Flexibility, Complexity, Functionality are different considerations which may be taken into effect when selecting a database type. Different NoSQL types listed above have different ratings on these parameters, for example, Key Value has high performance and scalability, flexibility, but might not have as much functionality as Graph databases, which may have lower performance and scalability, and high complexity.

* Most NoSQL databases do not support multi-record ACID transactions, however some, such as MongoDB do.
* Joins are not really required in noSQL databases.

### CAP Theorem

What is the real purpose of NoSQL databases?

* Consistency

- The system should be available after an execution. When writes to a shared source are available to all readers, the ratio of time availability is the consistency.

* Availability

- How much a system respons to the loss of functionality of different hardware or software systems. High availability implies the system is still available to handle operations, even if a certain part of the system is down due to failure or upgrade.

* Partition Tolerance

- The capability for a system to continue operations in the event of a network partition. Network partitions occur when a failure causes two or more islands of networks where systems cannot talk to each other across the islands temporarily.

Allegedly, two of these three characterisitcs can be chosen in a shared-data system. "Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance - Pick Two."  Systems which value reliability may
