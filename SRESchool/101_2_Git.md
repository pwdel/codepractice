# Git

Things I already know:

1. Creating a git repo.
2. Tracking a file / ignoring a file.
3. Commits

#### Visualizing Commits

* 'git log' prints a log of all of the git commits.
* --onlineshows the shorter version.
* --graph puts it in graph format:

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# git log --oneline --graph
* df7e87f (HEAD -> master) Adding file 2
* eef43fa adding file 1
```
So above we see two commits, one after another, lline by line.

If we were to print this out in non-oneline, non-graph mode, we would get:

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# git log
commit df7e87f888c796737150f6fb284c8cf8a9444593 (HEAD -> master)
Author: hi <hi@example.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 9 17:33:28 2021 +0000

    Adding file 1

commit eef43facd36926f9c194519e222b916434e846c3
Author: hi <hi@example.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 9 17:29:09 2021 +0000

    adding file 2
```
* Note that the top commit shown is the most recent.
* Note that the commit name, "df7e87f" is actually a shortened version of the entire object id.
#### Linked Commits

Are commits linked?

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# git cat-file -p  df7e87f
tree a6e73a89df73500b16cb22061b0435ad76968ad7
parent eef43facd36926f9c194519e222b916434e846c3
author hi <hi@example.com> 1636479208 +0000
committer hi <hi@example.com> 1636479208 +0000

Adding file 2
```

* the, "parent" attribute in the above structure points to, "eef43fa," which is the previous commit.

We can look at the git objects within a folder like so:

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# ls .git/objects/
12  1f	a6  b9	df  ee	info  pack
```
Looking at this recursively, we see:

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# ls -R .git/objects/
.git/objects/:
12  1f	a6  b9	df  ee	info  pack

.git/objects/12:
09fa88bb4ea869c1fd17441278fe8d5821dfd2

.git/objects/1f:
2ed0f726f7229ddd067bd7b71690a2e5521c35

.git/objects/a6:
e73a89df73500b16cb22061b0435ad76968ad7

.git/objects/b9:
b82ab2c6e4e44403952fdd8f4dd4d579e4fee5

.git/objects/df:
7e87f888c796737150f6fb284c8cf8a9444593

.git/objects/ee:
f43facd36926f9c194519e222b916434e846c3

.git/objects/info:

.git/objects/pack:

```

* Where for example in folder, "df" we see "7e87f888c796737150f6fb284c8cf8a9444593" - which, combined together is our most recent commit, "df7e87f888c796737150f6fb284c8cf8a9444593".
* The same works for folder, "ee"
* The tree is shown as: "a6" and "e73a89df73500b16cb22061b0435ad76968ad7"

Basically the first two digits are the folder name while the remainder is the object name.

If you look at the object, it is an extremely long set of characters.

```

#### Version Control

* We have two commits in our git log.
* Version control tool gives you the ability to browse back and forth in history.

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# ls
file1.txt  file2.txt
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# git log --oneline --graph
* df7e87f (HEAD -> master) Adding file 2
* eef43fa adding file 2
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# git checkout eef43fa
Note: switching to 'eef43fa'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at eef43fa adding file 1
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# ls
file1.txt
```
Note how our history only shows that file1.txt existing on the commit we switched to.

#### Reference

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was eef43fa adding file 1
Switched to branch 'master'
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# ls
file1.txt  file2.txt
```

#### References and the Magic

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# git log --oneline --graph
* df7e87f (HEAD -> master) Adding file 2
* eef43fa adding file 1
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# cat .git/refs/heads/master
df7e87f888c796737150f6fb284c8cf8a9444593
```
* The above shows that where the master is pointing to, by holding the git object in that folder.
* The head in turn points at the master folder:

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
```
#### Little Adventure

You can manually point the master to point to the first commit, rather than the second.

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# echo eef43facd36926f9c194519e222b916434e846c3 > .git/refs/heads/master

[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# git log --oneline --graph
* eef43fa (HEAD -> master) adding file 1
```

So basically that's all git is doing, it's just re-writing these objects into the appropriate system of folders.

### Branches

#### Merges

* Merge locally before moving on seems to be the more common strategy.

There are different merge options.

```
git merge b1
```

We have written up a decent amount on merging in a different area.

### Github and Hooks

* Github has a feature called, "hooks."

Hooks are scripts that can be called when an event happens.

```
[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# ls .git/hooks/
applypatch-msg.sample	   post-update.sample	  pre-merge-commit.sample  pre-receive.sample
commit-msg.sample	   pre-applypatch.sample  pre-push.sample	   prepare-commit-msg.sample
fsmonitor-watchman.sample  pre-commit.sample	  pre-rebase.sample	   update.sample
```

So for example, if you want to run tests before pushing code, you could set up pre-push hooks.

```
echo "echo this from a pre commit hook" > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit


[root@5bbb45ed5b82 temp]# git commit -m "Adding file 2 and 3"
this from a pre commit hook
[master 70d2559] Adding file 2 and 3
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 file2.txt
 create mode 100644 file3.txt

```
