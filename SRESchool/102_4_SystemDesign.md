# System Design

### About System Design

* Typically system design is something abstract, but within the domain of SRE, we are forced to think more specifically.
* Application requirements become components in a system.

This is known as Non-Abstract Large System Design (NALSD)

> “Practically, NALSD combines elements of capacity planning, component isolation, and graceful system degradation that are crucial to highly available production systems.”

#### SLI's - Service Level Indicators

> service level indicator(SLI) as “a carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.

#### SLO - Service Level Objective

Service level objective (SLO) is defined as “a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI”.
