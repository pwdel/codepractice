-- Consider the following data table named Student.
-- Name                Number  Sex
-- Nina                3412    F
-- Mike                1234    M
-- Nelson              2341    F

-- What is the count of attributes (columns) returned in the following projection?
-- Note the notation
-- Ï€(Name, Number)(Student)
-- This means there are 2 attributes we are looking for - Name,Number

-- Relational algebra example:
-- https://www.cs.scranton.edu/~mccloske/courses/cmps340/rel_alg_intro_lec.html

-- so basically we have to make a projection first
-- then do a count
